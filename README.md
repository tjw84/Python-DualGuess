# Python-DualGuess
A guess my numbers game in Python

# Overview

This is my take on the "guess my number game" using two numbers instead of one. The numbers given by the user will be checked against two randomly generated numbers the were made before the user prompt. The first prompted number will be compared against the first generated number and likewise for the second. If the user would like to play again then they can input 1, otherwise they can quit with 0. If the user gives an invalid input (a string, a float, a double, or an out of bounds integer) than it will ask them for their numbers again.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code, Github (obviously), Youtube, and Microsoft Edge to develop, explain, and showcase this software.

- Python was used with the Random module imported
